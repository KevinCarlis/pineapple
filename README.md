# Pineapple


## Installation
Requires python3 with pygame installed
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

## How to Play
Pineapple is a form of Chinese Poker. The goal is to create three poker hands where the bottom is better than the middle which is better than the top. The top can only hold three cards and therefore can only score a Three of a Kind, a Pair or a High Card. After your initial five cards you are dealt three cards per turn where you play two and discard one.


## Needs Work
Add player object with running point totals. I want to add a cheat button to see the odds of completing a hand. Documentation/testing*


## Quirks
Some things might seem erroneous
- Cards move to right most position if dropped in a slot with an existing card
- There is a dead screen between turns because you aren't supposed to see the card your opponent discards


## Note on Packaging
This project is just something to do in my spare time so I might never get around to properly packaging, documenting and testing. I see this mostly as an exercise and am solely interested in functionality.
